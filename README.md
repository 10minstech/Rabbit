**Another Zawgyi <=> Unicode Converter**

Zawgyi to Unicode has been written in [2011](https://github.com/saturngod/ZG2Uni_JS/commits/master). Now, unicode to zawgyi has been finished.

### Why another converter ?

When I was writting [ZG2uni](https://github.com/saturngod/ZG2Uni_JS/) , [Parabaik](https://github.com/ngwestar/parabaik) is not opensource. At that time, I need to use for [MYSTERY ZILLION](http://www.mysteryzillion.org) for converting the whole database to Unicode.

For Unicode to zawgyi , Parabaik is the GPL license and cannot use in iOS app and Android App. So, decided to write new one with **WTFPL license**.

> I cannot promise , it's correct 100% after converting.

> If you are not using in app or program and just for converting the text , please use [Parabaik](https://github.com/ngwestar/parabaik)
